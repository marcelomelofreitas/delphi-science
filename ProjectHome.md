This project holds the code examples that is detailed in my blog delphiscience.wordpress.com.
DelphiScience blog is a platform to share my personal work on scientific programming , artifical intelligence and mathematical/physical/bialogical/philosophical modelling. In addition to these subjects; as a Software Engineer and huge fan of Delphi, I will try to make a little science of Delphi also. Most of the code examples in this blog will be based on the new cross-paltform framework Firemonkey which is introduced by Embercadero as the future of the software development. I will try to post articles on the usage and details of this new framework.
